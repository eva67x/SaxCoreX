# Source Code (*Not available yet*)
This folder contains all the source code to the SaxCoreX plugin, this will be updated everytime I make a successful update.\
You have to clone everything in this folder to a zip file.\
Since you are a github user you should know how to clone so I won't explain that.

# REQUIREMENTS
*You will need a:*\
IDE (Eclipse for Java Devs recommended)\
Spigot library (If you are a mc plugin dev you should know how to import the spigot library)\
And a way of exporting it so you can use it for personal use on your minecraft server.\
***And you're done!***
