SaxCoreX is a Minecraft Paper (Paper is a fork of spigot/bukkit) Plugin, the plugin is currently in beta.
# Where can I find the raw jarfiles?
You can find the jarfiles in the ***jarfiles*** folder in this repository.
Later on in the development I will add uncompiled maven so you can compile the plugin yourself.

The license type is a MIT License, I advise you read the license before editing or republishing the plugin yourself.
All the stuff is in the license
