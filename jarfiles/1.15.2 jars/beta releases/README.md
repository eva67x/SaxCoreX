# The 1.15.2 version of SaxCoreX is not available yet, 
If you wish to convert the plugin feel free to create a pull request with the converted file version.
Once made I will check it as soon as I have time to make sure it works fully with the minecraft version and I will accept the pull request and add it.
# Note
In your pull request you must write down the supported minecraft version that you converted it for.
The file must also be a jarfile and has to be compatible with the version you converted it for, SaxCoreX is intended to work on Paper (Fork of Spigot/Bukkit) servers.
If the file contains any type of backdoors or frontdoors they will be removed from the code so don't attempt to add them. SaxCoreX is not some plugin for hacking mc servers with.
# END
Welp it ends here.
I advise you read the license if you ever do want to redistribute it.
